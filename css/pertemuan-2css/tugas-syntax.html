    <h1>Who is umar ibn khattab?</h1>
    <br />
    <p>
      <i>Umar ibn al-Khattab</i> was the <i>second Muslim caliph</i> (634-644
      CE), known for leading the early Islamic empire's expansion and for
      establishing principles of justice and equality under his rule. Born in
      <i>mecca </i> 584 CE, he was a strong, educated, and renowned wrestler and
      orator who initially opposed <i>Muhammad</i> before becoming a devout
      follower and close companion. As caliph, Umar's reign saw the conquest of
      Mesopotamia, Syria, Iran, and Egypt, transforming the Islamic state into a
      world power.

    <h2>The story of how he became a muslim</h2>
    <p>
      <i>Umar</i> initially was a strong adversary of the <i>Prophet Muhammad</i> and Islam,
      even plotting to harm him. One day, he heard his sister reciting verses
      from the <i>Quran,</i> which deeply affected him. He then went to the <i>Prophet
      Muhammad,</i> declared his acceptance of Islam, and joined the community of
      Muslims.
